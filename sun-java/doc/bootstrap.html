<TITLE>How to bootstrap java</TITLE>

Here are some brief instructions on how to bootstrap java:

<UL>

<LI> First, get the .class files from another system that already has
java working. You need every normally built .class file under the
classsrc subdirectory. Use your favoriate tree copying utility. You
can also use the existing moz*.zip or java_* file that matches what you 
want to build - just unzip it before proceeding. <P>

<LI> Next build a copy of javah:
<PRE>
cd sun-java/javah
gmake
</PRE> <P>

<LI> Once you have javah you can construct the generated header files:
<PRE>
cd sun-java/include
gmake
</PRE>

<LI> Now you can build a runtime:
<PRE>
cd sun-java/runtime ; gmake
cd sun-java/md ; gmake
cd sun-java/java; gmake
</PRE>


<LI> Install the runtime in /usr/local/bin:
<PRE>
cd sun-java/java
cp $(OBJDIR)/java /usr/local/bin
rehash (if you are using csh/tcsh)
</PRE>

<LI> And start a clean build to get a full build:
<PRE>
cd sun-java
gmake clobber
gmake
</PRE>

</UL>
