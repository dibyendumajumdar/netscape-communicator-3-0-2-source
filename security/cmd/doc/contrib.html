<h1>SSL Contrib Programs</h1>

<h2><b>rsh</b></h2>

The code for <b>rsh</b> is in the directory <b>security/rsh</b>.  This is
the 4.4BSD version of <b>rsh</b>, with modifications to compile on various
unix machines, and support for SSL and socks added.  Several arguments have
been added to support the new features.  The syntax for the command line
is:<p>
<b>rsh [-n] [-d] [-l </b><i>login</i><b>] </b><i>host</i><b> [</b><i>command</i><b>]</b><br>
<b>rsh [-n] [-d] -S </b><i>secargs</i><b> [-K </b><i>certdir</i><b>] [-k </b><i>nickname</i><b>] [-l </b><i>login</i><b>] </b><i>host</i><b> [</b><i>command</i><b>]</b><p>

The <b>-n</b> flag indicates that <b>rsh</b> should not process any input.<p>

The <b>-d</b> flag turns on some debugging.<p>

The <b>-S</b> flag sets the security parameters.  The <i>secargs</i> string
should be two character long.  If the first character is 'e' then encryption
is enabled.  Any other value of the first character will turn off encryption.
If the second character is 'p' then a socks proxy is used.  Any other value
of the second character will disable socks and attempt to use a direct
connection.  <b>NOTE: If you are using socks then you should have the
environment variable SOCKS_HOST set to the name of your socks proxy
machine.</b><p>

The <b>-K</b> flag specifies the location of the key and certificate databases
as the <i>certdir</i> directory. Without this flag, the default is
<i>/usr/etc/ssl</i>, unless the environment variable <b>SSL_DIR</b> has been
set to override this default.<p>

The <b>-k</b> flag enables client authentication. If the server requests
client authentication, the <i>nickname</i> string will be used to access
the client's key and certificate.  The user will then be prompted for a password
for the key.  The key and certificate databases will be read from the
default directory, unless otherwise specified (see above).<p>

The <b>-l</b> flag logs you into the remote host as <i>login</i> rather
than the current local username.<p>

<i>host</i> is the hostname or address of the machine to connect to and
execute <i>command</i>.<p>

If encryption is enabled then <b>rsh</b> will attempt to connect to the
port for a service named "shells".  If encryption is not being used then
it will connect to the standard "shell" port.  If you want to use encryption
then you should add a line to <b>/etc/services</b> specifying a port for
the "shells" service.<p>

If you don't enable encryption or socks use via <b>-S</b> then this
<b>rsh</b> acts like the normal bsd version of <b>rsh</b>.<p>

<b>rsh</b> needs to be suid root, or be run as root.<p>

<h2><b>rshd</b></h2>
The code for <b>rshd</b> is in <b>security/rshd</b>.  This is the 4.4BSD
version or <b>rshd</b> with a few modifications so that it can be run
from <b>ssld</b>.  This version of <b>rshd</b> does not do SSL directly,
but rather it expects to be run by <b>ssld</b>.  It uses the <b>ssld</b>
control socket to create the stderr connection back to the client
application.<p>

<b>WARNING: This version of rshd has its reserved port checking
disabled.  This enables use of secure rsh through a socks proxy, but it
bypasses one of the traditional security measures of unix based networking.
This is probably not much of a loss given how easy it is to get around today,
but it may introduce a security hole if things are not configured correctly.
It is strongly recomended that you configure ssld to use an access control list
to ensure that only trusted people can access your system via rshd.</b><p>

A sample line from the <b>ssld</b> configuration file to enable <b>rshd</b>
might look like this:<p>

<pre>
#Port	Mode	      ACL        Key	  Cert	  Action
445	auth-server   rsh.acl    NAME     NAME	  exec ./rshd rshd
</pre>

Notice that this configuration requires client authentication and has
an access control list.  Both are highly recommended.<p>

<h2><b>rdist</b></h2>

The code for <b>rdist</b> is in <b>security/rdist</b>.  This is the 6.1.0
version of <b>rdist</b> from USC.  The original is available for anonymous
ftp from <b>usc.edu</b>.  This version has been modified to take some extra
security arguments and to prompt the user for a password, which is passed
to the SSL version of <b>rsh</b>.  The new arguments are <b>-k</b>, <b>-K</b>,
and <b>-S</b>, which are just passed through to <b>rsh</b>.  If you don't
specify any of these arguments then <b>rdist</b> uses the operating system's
version of <b>rsh</b> and should behave like the un-modified <b>rdist</b>.<p>

The default pathname for secure <b>rsh</b> is <i>/usr/etc/ssl/srsh</i>.  
You can override this with the <b>-P</b> option in <b>rdist</b>.<p>

The version of <b>rdistd</b> included here has not been modified.  It is
included here for completeness.  If you already have the current version of
<b>rdistd</b> installed on the target system then you do not need to
install this version.<p>

<b>WARNING: Since this version of rdist uses secure rsh, the same security
considerations mentioned for rsh and rshd apply to rdist.</b><p>
