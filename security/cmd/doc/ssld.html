<title>SSLD - The SSL Daemon</title>
<!-- Changed by: David Karlton, 28-Feb-1996 -->
<center><h1>SSLD - The SSL Daemon</h1></center>

<b>ssld</b> is a daemon that can serve as an ssl proxy for non-ssl aware
tcp based applications.  <b>ssld</b> will connect securely to an ssl-aware
server on behalf of a non-ssl client, and can accept secure connections
from ssl based clients on behalf of a non-secure server.  Two <b>ssld</b>
processes can be used to set up a secure communications channel between
two non-secure processes.

<h2>Running <b>ssld</b></h2>

The command syntax for <b>ssld</b> is:<p>

<b>ssld-* [-i] [-D] [-d</b> <i>keydir</i><b>] [-c </b><i>conffile</i><b>] [-C </b><i>chrootdir</i><b>]</b><p>

where * is one of <b>us</b> or <b>ex</b> to specify using the domestic
or international versions, respectively.<p>

The <b>-i</b> option causes <b>ssld</b> to run in interactive mode.  If
this option is not specified <b>ssld</b> will fork.<p>

The <b>-D</b> option enables debugging messages.  It also enables interactive
mode, just as <b>-i</b> does.<p>

The <b>-d</b> option tells <b>ssld</b> to read key and certificate files
from the directory <i>keydir</i>.  The default directory is
<b>/usr/etc/ssl</b>.  The encrypted key database is named <b>key.db</b>,
and the certificate database is <b>cert.db</b>. The name index for the
certificate database is <b>cert-nameidx.db</b>. If you set an environment
variable <b>SSL_DIR</b> to a directory path, <b>ssld</b> will search there.
The <b>-d</b> option overrides this variable.<p>

The <b>-c</b> option indicates that <i>conffile</i> should be used as the
<b>ssld</b> configuration file.  The default configuration file is
<b>ssld.conf</b>. You may also set an environment variable <b>SSLD_CONF</b>
to avoid specifying this option at the command line. The <b>-c</b> option
overrides this variable. If the configuration filename
begins with a '/', it is assumed to be a full pathname. Otherwise, the
configuration file is searched for in the whatever directory is specified
with <b>-d</b> or <b>SSL_DIR</b> (the default being <b>/usr/etc/ssl</b>).<p>

The <b>-C</b> option causes <b>ssld</b> to change its root directory
to <i>chrootdir</i> via the <i>chroot(2)</i> system call.<p>

<h2>The <b>ssld</b> Configuration File</h2>

The <b>ssld</b> configuration file contains one line per port that it
will listen on.  Each line contains six entries.  They are <i>port</i>,
<i>mode</i>, <i>acl</i>, <i>keyname</i>, <i>certname</i>, and <i>action</i>.<p>

The <i>port</i> is the port number or service name that can be looked up
by <i>getservbyname(3)</i>, of a port that ssld will listen on.<p>

The <i>mode</i> field indicates to <b>ssld</b> how to treat a connection
once it is made.  There are four valid values for <i>mode</i>, which are
<b>client</b>, <b>server</b>, <b>auth-client</b>, and <b>auth-server</b>.
The meaning of the modes is as follows:<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>client <i>(BROKEN)</i></b>
<dd>The incoming connection is in the clear, and the forwarding connection
will use SSL.  <b>ssld</b> will perform the ssl handshake as a client.

<dt><b>auth-client <i>(BROKEN)</i></b>
<dd>Same as <b>client</b> except that the ssl handshake will include
client authentication using <b>ssld</b>'s certificate.

<dt><b>server</b>
<dd>The incoming connection uses SSL.  <b>ssld</b> will talk to the
forwarding destination or exec'd daemon in the clear.  <b>ssld</b> will
perform the ssl handshake as a server.

<dt><b>auth-server</b>
<dd>Same as <b>server</b> except that the ssl handshake will require the
client to authenticate itself.
</dl><p>
The <i>acl</i> field can either be the name of a file containing an
access control list for this port, or a '-' indicating that there is no
access control on this port.  <b>NOTE: Access control lists only work
in auth-server mode.</b>  The access control list file contains a list
of names, one per line.  One of these names must match the common name
field of the subject of the client's certificate.  If no match is
found then <b>ssld</b> will drop the connection.<p>

The <i>keyname</i> field should be the nickname of the key that is accessed
from the <b>key.db</b> database located in the directory specified with
the <b>-d</b> option or the <b>SSL_DIR</b> environment variable.<p>

The <i>certname</i> field should be the nickname of the certificate that is
accessed from the <b>cert.db</b> database, always located in the same directory
as <b>key.db</b>.
<p>

The <i>action</i> consists of a keyword, followed by an argument list.
The two possible keywords are <b>forward</b> and <b>exec</b>.<p>

The argument to <b>forward</b> is a <i>host</i>:<i>port</i> string, where
<i>host</i> a hostname or ip address, and <i>port</i> is a port number
or service name.  <b>ssld</b> will connect to the given port on the
given host, and forward all data from the incoming connection to that
port, performing the appropriate ssl transformations based on the
<i>mode</i>.<p>

The arguments to <b>exec</b> are the pathname of the program to execute,
followed by the name of the program and its arguments.  The program is
run with the socket of the incoming connection cloned onto its stdin,
stdout, and stderr file descriptors, just like inetd.  In addition,
there is another socketpair created, one end of which is connected to 
file descriptor #3 of the exec'd program.  This socket is used to provide
a control channel between <b>ssld</b> and the exec'd program.  It allows
the exec'd program to create its own connections back through ssld.  This
is used by <b>rshd</b>.  See <b>sslref/contrib/rshd/rshd.c</b> and
<b>sslref/src/libutil/ssld_util.c</b> for details of how to use this
facility.<p>

<h2>Notes on Security</h2>

It is important to take some care in configuring <b>ssld</b>.  A careless
configuration could open some serious security holes.  Some things to
look out for:
<ul>
<li>A port configured in <b>auth-client</b> mode will allow anyone who can
connect to that port to do ssl, authenticated as you, using the certificate
that you ran <b>ssld</b> with.  You should take great care to make sure
that no one who you don't want pretending to be you can access that port,
either by configuring your firewall, or some other means.
<li>A port configured in <b>client</b> mode will allow anyone who can connect
to the port to appear to be coming from your machine.  A host based
authentication mechanism might give them access that they should not have.
</ul>
