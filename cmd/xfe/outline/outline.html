<p>The Outline Widget is something I'm working on when I'm not busy doing anything
else; hence, it's a slow project. It is currently in alpha state (v0.1.1alpha). I'd
prefer feedback on the usability on this code, so please go ahead and download it.

<p>It is really two widgets, that together form the basis for multilevel outlines. The
advantage of using two widgets instead of a huge, complex tree-like widget becomes
apparent when there is need for a flexible layout scheme with different types of
outlines.  

<p>The outline widget is a manager widget, not unlike a simple column manager. In
addition to manage children, it draws an outline.

<p>The other widget, the handle widget, manages a handle, a label, and an outline
widget. It enables collapsing and expanding, by unmanaging and managing its outline
widget. It manages children left to right, so having multiple children is possible.

<p>A typical example of a handle widget would be a toggle button, or an arrow button
that changes its direction depending on the state of the outlineHandle (collapsed |
expanded).

<p>I'm currently working on a folder widget which uses the outline widget to display
the contents of a folder (directory). This widget is not subclassed from the handle
widget, but is similar in design. It will be available in the 0.2alpha release.

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<ol>

<li>The handle widget does not correctly calculate child geometry.</li>

<li>Recalculating the layout implies a total redraw for the outline.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Todo</h2>

<ol>

<li>Implement proper navigation in multilevel outlines.</li>

<li>Implement XmNpacking support (XmPACK_TIGHT and XmPACK_NONE).

<li>Add code to simplify the creation of multilevel outlines.</li>

<li>Athena compatibility.</li>

</ol>

<p>This is alpha software. Now you are warned. The sources are available <a
href="outline.tar.gz">here</a>. Note that this file will untar into the current
directory.</p>

<p>The sources are also available at ftp.x.org in the /contrib/widgets/motif area as
outline.tar.gz.</p>
