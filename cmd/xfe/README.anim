The steps to providing a custom animation are as follows:

1 - Each frame of the animation is a separate GIF file.
    The person creating the animation should provide two series
    of GIFs, one for the small animation (recommended size 30x30)
    and one for the large animation (recommended size 60x60).
    You are free to use whatever size they want, but the small
    GIFs should all be the same size, and the large GIFS should all be the
    same size.

2 - Create an 'animation.dat' file by running 'mkanim'.
    Usage of mkanim is:  'mkanim image-files'.  All of the large image
    files should come first, followed by all of the small image files.
    Example:  If you have just two frames per animation, the command
    line might look like:
        mkanim big1.gif big2.gif small1.gif small2.gif
    This will create a file called 'animation.dat'

3 - Put the 'animation.dat' file in a publically accessable place.

4 - Specify the location of the 'animation.dat' file in the kit input
    file with the label "X animation file".

    Example: If the animation.dat is in /usr/local/netscape, the input
    file would have the line:

    X animation file = /usr/local/netscape/animation.dat
